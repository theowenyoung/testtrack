### Web server Modules / Meetups

*   [PageSpeed Module](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/download) - PageSpeed speeds up your site and reduces page load time. This open-source web server module automatically applies web performance best practices to pages and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow. PageSpeed is available as a module for Apache 2.x and Nginx 1.x.
*   [WebP-detect (‚≠ê240)](https://github.com/igrigorik/webp-detect) - WebP with Accept negotiation.
*   [Web Performance Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/) - The mission of the Web Performance Working Group, part of the Rich Web Client Activity, is to provide methods to measure aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs.
*   [Page Visibility](http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/) - This specification defines a means for site developers to programmatically determine the current visibility state of the page in order to develop power and CPU efficient web applications.
*   [Navigation Timing](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/) - This specification defines a unified interface to store and retrieve high resolution performance metric data related to the navigation of a document.
*   [Resource Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) - This specification defines an interface for web applications to access the complete timing information for resources in a document.
*   [User Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/user-timing/) - This specification defines an interface to help web developers measure the performance of their applications by giving them access to high precision timestamps.
*   [Performance Timeline](http://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline/) - This specification defines a unified interface to store and retrieve performance metric data. This specification does not cover individual performance metric interfaces.
*   [CSS will-change](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-will-change/) - This specification defines the `will-change` CSS property which allows an author to declare ahead-of-time what properties are likely to change in the future, so the UA can set up the appropriate optimizations some time before they‚Äôre needed. This way, when the actual change happens, the page updates in a snappy manner.
*   [Resource Hints](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/) - This specification defines the dns-prefetch, preconnect, prefetch, and prerender relationships of the HTML Link Element (\<link>). These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance.
*   [HTTP Archive](http://httparchive.org/index.php) - It's a permanent repository of web performance information such as size of pages, failed requests, and technologies utilized. This performance information allows us to see trends in how the Web is built and provides a common data set from which to conduct web performance research.
