# Awesome Leadership and Management [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## What This Is, and Where It Comes From

Since 2013-ish, [Joe Goldberg](https://twitter.com/tenaciousjoe), who created the original document inspiring this list, read a crap-ton of books and articles about "leadership" and "management" and took notes along the way. He shared it with friends who were transitioning to management roles and eventually decided to open-source it. [Here you'll find Joe's still-public document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/edit#heading=h.loq53mbwc6ut), which provides meatier summaries of the articles you'll find listed here as well as lots of supplementary notes.

In summer 2017 [Lauri Apple](https://twitter.com/lauri_apple) found out about Joe's docs via [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) and asked Joe about posting the contents to GitHub. He gave the greenlight. Lauri changed up the format (very brief blurbs), turned the doc into an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), and has continued adding new entries ever since. Helping out with the initial upload were a team of Lauri's former colleagues at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/). These days the list receives [contributions](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing/blob/master/README.md/CONTRIBUTING.md) from people around the world.
