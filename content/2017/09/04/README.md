> There are plenty of "Caffeine" branded cafes around that have pretty good wifi and service. English speakers are hit and miss, be prepared for a lot of random pointing and confusion. If you're paying with a credit card, expect people freaking out about what to do with a receipt that requires signing (no POS systems here support PINs).

### Netherlands üá≥üá± / Amsterdam

#### Knygynas DRAUGYSTƒñ

> A cafe connected to a bookshop. Very tolerant of hacker types who never leave. Wifi is about 8mbit, and fairly stable. Most speak enough English you can order a coffee, and the coffee is good. Cow milk only.
