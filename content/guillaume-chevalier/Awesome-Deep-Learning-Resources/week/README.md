To sum up: with Matching Networks, you can optimize directly for a cosine similarity between examples (like a self-attention product would match) which is passed to the softmax directly. I guess that Matching Networks could probably be used as with negative-sampling softmax training in word2vec's CBOW or Skip-gram without having to do any context embedding lookups.
