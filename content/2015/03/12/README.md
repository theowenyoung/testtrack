## [2. Awesome Courses](/content/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/README.md)

### Courses / Systems

*   [15-213](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~213/) **Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)** *Carnegie-Mellon University*  <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Videos" title="Lecture Videos" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" />
    *   The ICS course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.
    *   This is the must-have course for everyone in CMU who wants to learn some computer science no matter what major are you in. Because it's CMU (The course number is as same as the zip code of CMU)!
    *   [Lecture Notes](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~213/schedule.html)
    *   [Videos](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22)
