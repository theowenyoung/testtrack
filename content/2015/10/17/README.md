### Record Holders and Extremes / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+0F33](https://codepoints.net/U+0F33) TIBETAN DIGIT HALF ZERO - code point that
    represents the *lowest* ‚Äúsingle-digit‚Äù number and at the same time the
    only negative one, -¬Ω.
*   The trophy for most useless code points goes to
    [U+0080](https://codepoints.net/U+0080),
    [U+0081](https://codepoints.net/U+0081) and
    [U+0099](https://codepoints.net/U+0099). These so-called C1 control
    characters are more or less unspecified. They got into Unicode, because
    they were present in the very first version of what should later become ISO
    10646, the ISO-standardized version of Unicode. They [were meant to be part
    of an upgrade to ISO
    2022](http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m10/0050.html), that
    never came to be.
