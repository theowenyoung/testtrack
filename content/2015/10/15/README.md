## [1. Awesome PICO 8](/content/pico-8/awesome-PICO-8/README.md)

### Contents / Resources

*   [Going from Lua 5.2 to PICO-8's Lua](https://gist.github.com/josefnpat/bfe4aaa5bbb44f572cd0) - This document is here to help folks with a proficiency in Lua understand the limitations and discrepencies between Lua and PICO-8's Lua.

## [2. Toolsforactivism](/content/drewrwilson/toolsforactivism/README.md)

### Projects to keep an eye on (ie projects in development)

*   [Stencil Validator](https://drewrwilson.com/stencilvalidator/) ([code (‚≠ê12)](https://github.com/drewrwilson/stencilvalidator)) - a design tool for determining if your artwork is a valid stencil

## [3. Awesome Tech Videos](/content/lucasviola/awesome-tech-videos/README.md)

### Motivation / Scala

*   [Impossible Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN63FOa_Gp4) By Tom Stuart

## [4. Awesome D3](/content/wbkd/awesome-d3/README.md)

### Miscellaneous / Third Party

*   [d3.sketchy (‚≠ê241)](https://github.com/sebastian-meier/d3.sketchy) - Creates sketchy backgrounds, shapes and lines

## [5. Awesome Codepoints](/content/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints/README.md)

### Standalone Code Points

*   The code points of the Unicode blocks [Box
    Drawing](https://codepoints.net/box_drawing) (U+2500 to U+257F) and [Block
    Elements](https://codepoints.net/block_elements) (U+2580 to U+259F) cover
    most of your monospace command-line visualization needs.

          ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
          ‚îÇUnicode‚îÇ
          ‚îÇrules! ‚îÇ
          ‚ï∞‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚ïØ
*   [U+2E2E](https://codepoints.net/U+2E2E) REVERSED QUESTION MARK - the ‚Äúirony
    mark‚Äù to express irony/sarcasm. A useful character‚∏Æ
*   [U+D800](https://codepoints.net/U+D800) to
    [U+DFFF](https://codepoints.net/U+DFFF) - surrogate code points. They are
    only reserved to ease [UTF-16
    encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16).
*   [U+1D455](https://codepoints.net/U+1D455) is missing. It would be an italic
    small ‚Äúh‚Äù. It was not encoded, because it would be identical to the Planck
    constant ‚Ñé ([U+210E](https://codepoints.net/U+210E)).

### Code Points that Affect Others

*   Diacritics and combining marks: There is a [host of
    characters](https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn), that add
    to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks. Unicode
    provides a [handy FAQ](http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html) on the
    details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character, it is placed
    on top of that previous one. So, `a + Ãä = √•`. This *may* lead to all kinds
    of funny problems, because for some combinations there are pre-composed
    characters. Our little `√•` here can also be encoded as U+00E5. You might
    note, that while this has a length of one character, the combination of `a`
    and combining ring has a length of two characters.

    Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
    [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195) on StackOverflow.

### Record Holders and Extremes / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+1F402](https://codepoints.net/U+1F402) OX - shortest name.
*   [U+FDFA](https://codepoints.net/U+FDFA) ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE
    WASALLAM - longest decomposition form: 18 characters.

### For Funsies / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+1680](https://codepoints.net/U+1680) OGHAM SPACE MARK - a space that looks
    like a dash. Great to bring programmers close to madness: `1¬†+¬†·öÄ2 === 3`.
*   [U+037E](https://codepoints.net/U+037E) GREEK QUESTION MARK - a look-alike to
    the semicolon. Also a fun way to annoy developers.
*   [U+1F574](https://codepoints.net/U+1F574) MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING -
    A rather curious character, that only made it into Unicode for its
    appearance in the Webdings font (for reasons of backwards compatibility).
*   [U+1F596](https://codepoints.net/U+1F596) RAISED HAND WITH PART BETWEEN
    MIDDLE AND RING FINGERS - the Vulcan salute. Live long and prosper!
    Ôññ
*   [U+1F918](https://codepoints.net/U+1F918) SIGN OF THE HORNS - Rock on!
    Ô§ò

## [6. Awesome Aws](/content/donnemartin/awesome-aws/README.md)

### Open Source Repos / Data

*   [donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire: (‚≠ê24k)](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks) - Big data/data science notebooks.
