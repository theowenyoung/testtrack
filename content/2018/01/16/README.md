### Messaging

*   [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers.

*   [Mailpile](http://www.mailpile.is/) is free software, a web-mail program that you run on your own computer, so your data stays under your control. Because it is free software (a.k.a. open source), you can look under the hood and see how it works, or even modify it to make it better suit your particular needs. Mailpile is designed for speed and vast amounts of e-mail, it is flexible and themeable and has support for strong encryption built in from the very start.
*   [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) is an open standard for decentralised communication, providing simple HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting JSON over an open federation of servers. You can use Matrix for any project where you need a common data fabric to link together fragmented silos of communication.

*   Samizdat is a self-replicating LiveCD which creates an IPSec VPN between each newly-created LiveCD node and the system that created it.  It is thus "rhizomal" in the sense of Serval, but its objectives are more like those of arkOS: each node runs peer-to-peer services intended to replace the centralized services of github, skype, facebook, gmail, etc..  Samizdat provides strong cryptography for authentication of users over the network, and full disk encryption for installed systems, providing novice users fully-automated (zero-learning-curve) access to high-grade security.  Samizdat's installer does not ask any questions of the user except where to install.  The goal of Samizdat is to provide the benefits of public key cryptography to users who do not even understand what public key cryptography is.(Samizdat is also -- incidentally -- a generic framework for creating and managing LiveCD images for other purposes, such as managing multiple systems on a LAN, or system backup.)Send mail to [samizdat@lists.riseup.net](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet/blob/master/README.md/mailto:samizdat@lists.riseup.net) (public mailing list) or [samizdat@childrenofmay.org](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet/blob/master/README.md/mailto:samizdat@childrenofmay.org) (private email of project founder) for more information.

Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication). Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent. Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted. Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors. Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system. More information on [documentation page](http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/)
