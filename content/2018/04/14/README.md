### Compilers, Transpilers and Languages

*   [Testura.Code (‚≠ê258)](https://github.com/Testura/Testura.Code) - Wrapper around the Roslyn API and used for generation, saving and compiling C# code. It provides methods and helpers to generate classes, methods, statements and expressions.

## [7. Awesome Roslyn](/content/ironcev/awesome-roslyn/README.md)

### Open Source Projects

*   [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) - Enables a cross platform .NET development in the editor of your choice. A family of open source projects, each with one goal: To enable a great .NET experience in your editor of choice.
*   [roslyn-linq-rewrite (‚≠ê703)](https://github.com/antiufo/roslyn-linq-rewrite) - Compiles C# code by first rewriting the syntax trees of LINQ expressions using plain procedural code. This increases performance by minimizes heap allocations and dynamic dispatch.
