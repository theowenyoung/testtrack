    *   This course develops techniques used in the design and analysis of algorithms, with an emphasis on problems arising in computing applications. Example applications are drawn from systems and networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, data mining, and computational biology. This course covers four major algorithm design techniques (greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and network flow), computability theory focusing on undecidability, computational complexity focusing on NP-completeness, and algorithmic techniques for intractable problems, including identification of structured special cases, approximation algorithms, and local search heuristics.

### Courses / CS Theory

*   [CS 6810](https://complexity16.dsteurer.org/) **Theory of Computing** *Cornell University* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Readings" title="Readings" />
    *   This graduate course gives a broad introduction to complexity theory, including classical results and recent developments. Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:
        *   Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?
        *   Do more computational resources mean more computing power?
        *   Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?
        *   Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?
        *   Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?
        *   Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?

### Courses / Misc

*   [CS 4812](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/physics4481-7681_2018fa/) **Quantum Information Processing** *Cornell University* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Readings" title="Readings" />
    *   Hardware that exploits quantum phenomena can dramatically alter the nature of computation. Though constructing a working quantum computer is a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering strikingly different perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by the quantum theory. The course is intended both for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and also for computer scientists and mathematicians, unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The prerequisites are familiarity (and comfort) with finite dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers, some standard group theory, and ability to count in binary.
