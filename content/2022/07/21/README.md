### Videos / Others

*   [Making Blazor work with everything, plus WebAssembly on the server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RevmsFXVJ5Q) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-60%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 13, 2022 - Talk by Steve Sanderson at the NDC London 2022. Real-world software projects often involve combining many technologies. So, is modern Blazor powerful and flexible enough for your team's needs? In this demo-heavy talk, Steve will show how Blazor WebAssembly/Server can seamlessly embed libraries and logic written in other languages such as Rust or C/C++, how Blazor WebAssembly/Server components can be used inside other SPA frameworks such as React or Angular (or vice-versa) and how Blazor components can be used not only for web projects, but also shared with native apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows (including WPF and WinForms) These capabilities should equip your team to take on the most ambitious projects with confidence. We'll then look further into the future and consider how WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser and is pitched to become a foundational element of cloud-native server apps. You'll be among the first to see an experimental new approach to compiling .NET applications into WASI-compliant universal binaries that can run on any OS or processor, robustly sandboxed and with great performance.

When developing a Single Page Application, a very important aspect is state management. Since Blazer is a component-based UI framework, how do we manage to update the UI when the state of the application changes.
