## [9. Awesome Crypto Papers](/content/pFarb/awesome-crypto-papers/README.md)

### Specific topics / Secret key cryptography

*   [DES is not a group](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48071-4_36.pdf) - Old but gold mathematical proof that the set of DES permutations (encryption and decryption for each DES key) is not closed under functional composition. That means that multiple DES encryption is not equivalent to single DES encryption and means that the size of the subgroup generated by the set of DES permutations is greater than 10^2499, which is too large for potential attacks on DES, which would exploit a small subgroup.

### Specific topics / Cryptanalysis

*   [MEGA: Malleable Encryption Goes Awry](https://mega-awry.io/pdf/mega-malleable-encryption-goes-awry.pdf) - Proof-of-concept versions of attacks on MEGA data storage. Showcasing their practicality and exploitability. [Official webpage](https://mega-awry.io/).

### Specific topics / Post-quantum cryptography

*   [MAYO: Practical Post-Quantum Signatures from Oil-and-Vinegar Maps](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1144.pdf) - The Oil and Vinegar signature scheme, proposed in 1997 by Patarin, is one of the oldest and best-understood multivariate quadratic signature schemes. It has excellent performance and signature sizes. This paper is about enhancing this algorithm in usage in the post-quantum era. [Official website](https://pqmayo.org/).
