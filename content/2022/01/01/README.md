The conversation also digs into the evolution of Blazor Fluent UI and MAUI - which also leads to the futures conversation, taking advantage of multithreading, and other great features you can see in the road map on GitHub. More Blazor is coming. Duration: 60 minutes.
*   [OpenSilver Ships with Giovanni Albani](https://dotnetrocks.com/?show=1771) - December 9, 2021 - OpenSilver reaches V1!

Giovanni talks about how the client-side of OpenSilver is different from Silverlight, using Web Assembly to eliminate the need for the plug-in. But the developer SDK side is as close to identical as possible.
