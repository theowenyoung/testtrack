    for parts, radios, antennas and mounts.

### SDR (Software Defined Radio) / Hardware

*   **Recommended starter hardware** On the low end,
    [RTL-SDR](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) is a super-cheap usb
    dongle, around which a thriving community has been founded.
*   On the other side of the cost spectrum, [pervices](http://www.pervices.com/)
    makes some really high-throughput, PCIe devices for when you need to log all
    the traffic ever. The software and community support for this is less good,
    though (for which you can blame @outofculture).
*   You can also browse through the [big
    list](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Hardware) of all
    compatible hardware.
*   Antennas are their own body of options and tradeoffs, about which I know
    nothing.
