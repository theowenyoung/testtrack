## [1. Awesome Qt](/content/JesseTG/awesome-qt/README.md)

### Communities / Official

*   [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23qt%2C%23qt-quick%2C%23qt-creator%2C%23qt-chat) - For real-time chat with other Qt developers and users.  The most popular channels are on Freenode, and include `#qt`, `#qt-quick`, `#qt-creator`, and `#qt-chat`.
    *   For a full list of Qt-related IRC channels, see [here](https://wiki.qt.io/Online_Communities#IRC_channels).
    *   Note that the linked webchat client is *not* a part of the Qt project, and is provided by the author of this list for convenience only.  These channels can be accessed through any IRC client.

### Tools / Official Tools

*   [Qt Installer Framework](https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework) [:octocat: (‚≠ê147)](https://github.com/qtproject/installer-framework) - Nobody seems to talk about this, but Qt also provides a way to write an installer for your application.  Does not support creation of macOS disk images, app bundles, or Linux packages, so be mindful of that when considering your project's distribution.
    *   [`macdeployqt`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/osx-deployment.html) [:octocat: (‚≠ê125)](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/macdeployqt) - Generates macOS application bundles for Qt projects.
*   [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html) [:octocat: (‚≠ê1.8k)](https://github.com/qt/qtbase/tree/dev/qmake) - The bundled build system designed for Qt, though it can be used for non-Qt projects.
*   `qtdiag` [:octocat: (‚≠ê125)](https://github.com/qt/qttools/tree/dev/src/qtdiag) - Command-line tool that prints out a lot of information pertaining to both your Qt installation and your system in general.  No link because there's no dedicated web page; just run `qtdiag` on the command line.  Excellent for troubleshooting.
*   `qmleasing` [:octocat: (‚≠ê146)](https://github.com/qt/qtdeclarative/tree/dev/tools/qmleasing) - Lets you make easing curves suitable for QML, though if you understand the underlying math there's no reason you couldn't use the resulting numbers elsewhere.

### Tools / Third-Party Tools

*   [CMake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-manual.html) [:octocat: (‚≠ê5.2k)](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) - General C++ build tool that happens to have great Qt support.
*   [moc-ng (‚≠ê185)](https://github.com/woboq/moc-ng) [:octocat: (‚≠ê185)](https://github.com/woboq/moc-ng) - Alternative implementation of `moc` that's binary-compatible with Qt's version.
*   [Qt-Inspector (‚≠ê350)](https://github.com/robertknight/Qt-Inspector) [:octocat: (‚≠ê350)](https://github.com/robertknight/Qt-Inspector) - Inspection tool with similar goals to GammaRay, though much simpler.

### Bindings in Other Languages / Third-Party Tools

*   [Mono/.NET languages (via QtSharp) (‚≠ê557)](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp) [:octocat: (‚≠ê557)](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp) - Experimental wrapper for Qt that allows it to be used by .NET-based languages such as C#.  Young, but active.
