## [1. Awesome Fp Js](/content/stoeffel/awesome-fp-js/README.md)

### Resources / Books

*   [Professor Frisby‚Äôs Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming (‚≠ê22k)](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) ‚Äì This is a book on the functional paradigm in general using the world‚Äôs most popular functional programming language: JavaScript. It‚Äôs a practical introduction that builds up intuition through real-world examples. Strongly recommended. By [Brian Lonsdorf](https://twitter.com/drboolean) (2016)
*   [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix), the ‚ÄúSix‚Äù edition. Starts with as little as possible about functions ‚Äì but no less! ‚Äì and builds up towards powerful combinators and decorators. A foundational book. By [Reginald  Braithwaite](https://github.com/raganwald) (2016)
*   [Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript) teaches JavaScript developers functional techniques that will improve extensibility, modularity, reusability, testability, and performance. Through concrete examples and jargon-free explanations, this book teaches you how to apply functional programming to real-life development tasks. By Luis Atencio (2016)
*   [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). A modern introduction to programming using JavaScript. By Marijn Haverbeke (2014)
*   [Functional JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do) teaches how to create code that‚Äôs beautiful, safe, and simple to understand and test by using JavaScript‚Äôs functional programming support. By [Michael Fogus](https://github.com/fogus) (2013)

### Resources / Articles

*   [FP Concepts in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@collardeau/intro-to-functional-programming-concepts-in-javascript-b0650773139c) ‚Äì An introduction to Functional Programming Concepts in JavaScript. Uses the Ramda library to teach the concepts of composition, pointfree style, and functors through the simplest of examples.
*   [Functional programming with JavaScript](http://stephen-young.me.uk/2013/01/20/functional-programming-with-javascript.html) ‚Äì Another introduction to Functional Programming in JavaScript with a focus on three key themes: computation as the application of functions, statelessness, avoiding side effects.
*   [A gentle introduction to functional JavaScript](http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-functional-javascript-intro/) ‚Äì A four-part series introduction functional programming in JavaScript that gets you up to speed what all the hype about functional programming is all about.
*   [Why Curry Helps](https://hughfdjackson.com/javascript/why-curry-helps/) ‚Äì A short overview of how to write reusable and declarative code using currying.
*   [Favoring Curry](http://fr.umio.us/favoring-curry/) - Practical applications of currying using Ramda.
*   [JavaScript and Type Thinking](https://medium.com/@yelouafi/javascript-and-type-thinking-735edddc388d) ‚Äì Learn to reason about your JavaScript code with *type thinking*. Algebraic Data Types are introduced as a conceptual basis to reason about program entities.
*   [Why Ramda](http://fr.umio.us/why-ramda/) ‚Äì To those not used to functional programming, Ramda seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. However, it does offer a different style of coding, a style that‚Äôs taken for granted in purely functional programming languages: Ramda makes it simple for you to build complex logic through functional composition.
*   [A Monad in Practicality: First-Class Failures](http://robotlolita.me/2013/12/08/a-monad-in-practicality-first-class-failures.html) ‚Äì A walk through some practical use cases for specific monadic structures in JavaScript: use the `Maybe` monad to handle simple failure cases and model more complex scenarios with the `Either` monad or the `Validation` applicative functor.

### Resources / Videos

*   [Functional programming patterns for the non-mathematician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvgwKjTPMmM) ‚Äì Learn about practical use cases for functors, applicatives, and monads.
*   [Pure JavaScript](https://vimeo.com/49384334) ‚Äì Christian Johansen will show you how you can significantly up your game by leaving loops behind and embracing functions as the primary unit of abstraction.

### Resources / Examples and Exercises

*   [FPJS-Class (‚≠ê96)](https://github.com/loop-recur/FPJS-Class) ‚Äì Functional Programming learned through JavaScript.
*   [functional-javascript-workshop (‚≠ê2k)](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop) ‚Äì The goal of this workshop is to create realistic problems that can be solved using terse, vanilla, idiomatic JavaScript to teach fundamental functional programming features of JavaScript.
